- [ ] [Solvency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/solvency.asp)
```
Solvency just means, is the value of the assets greater than the value of the liability so that 
the net worth is greater than zero? This being a balancing item, is the net worth greater than 
zero? So this is about the market value of assets versus the market value of liabilities.
